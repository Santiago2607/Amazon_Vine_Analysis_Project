# Amazon_Vine_Analysis_Project

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to help the start-up marketing company, BigMarket, to optimize its marketing strategies and efforts through some data analysis. One of its main clients, Sellby, is going to share some valuable products and information on its website, however, they asked us to do an analysis of how its products' reviews compare to other's companies and based on that give new programs and rewards to its customers. 

In order to complete this new challenge, Jennifer, an account manager at BigMarket, will be of great support to us by analyzing this data. After some work done, we decided that the best strategy to analyze the extensive amount of data the company has is to use the power of Big Data plus some help from SQL, AWS, and Google Colaboratory. 

## Results

After getting some new results by using Google Colaboration and AWS, we figured out new and surprising results.

1. The total amount of Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews are:

## Summary

Due to the help of AWS, PgAdmin, Google Colaboration, and Big Data, we were able to show BigMarket the results of our analysis so he can take further action according to this. In addition, one last analysis that we took into consideration is to show the company that there is no more positive bias for reviews since there is a great difference between Vine and Non-Vine total reviews.
